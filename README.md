Hospital Management System üè•
Project Overview
This is a console-based Hospital Management System developed in Java, designed to streamline the process of managing patient records, doctor information, and appointments within a hospital setting. It demonstrates foundational skills in Java programming, object-oriented design, and database integration using JDBC with MySQL.

Features
Patient Management:

Add new patient records with details such as ID, name, age, and gender.

View a list of all registered patients.

Doctor Management:

View a list of all available doctors, including their IDs and specializations.

Appointment Scheduling:

Book appointments for patients with specific doctors on a given date.

Includes validation to ensure the patient and doctor exist, and the doctor is available.

Console-Based Interface:

An interactive menu-driven interface for easy navigation and interaction.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java

Database: MySQL

Database Connectivity: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

Development Environment: IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE)

Setup and Installation
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed.

MySQL Server installed and running.

A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) for development.

2. Database Setup
Create the Database:

CREATE DATABASE hospital_db;
USE hospital_db;

Create Tables:

CREATE TABLE patients (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL,
    gender VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE doctors (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    specialization VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE appointments (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    patient_id INT,
    doctor_id INT,
    appointment_date DATE NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES patients(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES doctors(id)
);

Insert Sample Data (Optional):

INSERT INTO doctors (name, specialization) VALUES ('Dr. Smith', 'Cardiology');
INSERT INTO doctors (name, specialization) VALUES ('Dr. Jones', 'Pediatrics');
INSERT INTO doctors (name, specialization) VALUES ('Dr. Lee', 'Neurology');

3. Project Configuration
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-management-system.git
cd hospital-management-system

(Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username)

Open in IDE: Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.

Update Database Credentials:

Locate the HospitalManagementSystem.java file (or a similar configuration file if created).

Update the DB_URL, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD variables to match your MySQL database configuration.

private static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hospital_db";
private static final String DB_USER = "your_mysql_username"; // e.g., "root"
private static final String DB_PASSWORD = "your_mysql_password"; // e.g., "password"

Add MySQL JDBC Driver:

Download the MySQL Connector/J.

Add the downloaded .jar file to your project's classpath (usually by adding it as a library in your IDE).

Usage
Compile and Run: Run the HospitalManagementSystem.java file from your IDE.

Interact: Follow the on-screen console prompts to perform actions like adding patients, viewing doctors, and booking appointments.

Future Enhancements
GUI Implementation: Transition from a console-based interface to a graphical user interface (e.g., JavaFX or Swing).

Advanced Appointment Management: Add features to view, update, or cancel existing appointments.

User Authentication: Implement login functionality for different user roles (e.g., admin, doctor, patient).

More Entities: Introduce additional entities like medical records, billing, or prescription management.

Error Logging: Implement a more robust error logging mechanism.
